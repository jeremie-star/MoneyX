# **Money-X (Currency Exchange Rate Tracker)**

This is a currency exchange rate tracker application that fetches real-time exchange rates from an API and displays the historical exchange rates in a graphical chart. The app automatically identifies the most frequently traded currency pair and displays its historical data.

## **Features**
- Fetches exchange rates from an external API.
- Automatically identifies the most frequently traded currency pair.
- Displays the historical exchange rate for the most frequently traded currency pair over a specified number of days.
- Visualizes the historical data using a chart.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: RESTful API to fetch exchange rates and historical data

## **Installation**

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeremie-star/Money-X.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open `index.html` in a browser or use a local server to view the app.

## **How It Works**

1. **Fetching Exchange Rates**:  
   The app fetches data from an external API that provides real-time exchange rates for various currencies.

2. **Identifying the Most Traded Currency Pair**:  
   The app analyzes the exchange rate data and identifies the most frequently traded currency pair based on the dataset.

3. **Displaying Historical Data**:  
   The app fetches and displays the historical exchange rates of the most traded currency pair. Users can specify the number of days for which they want to view the historical data.

4. **Rendering the Chart**:  
   The historical data is displayed using **Chart.js**, which allows users to visually analyze exchange rate trends over time.
